# Churn-Analysis-BA
Context


The leading telecom company has a massive market sharebut one big problem: several rivals that are constantly trying to steal customers.

Because this company has been the marketleader for so many years, there are not significant opportunities to grow with new customers.


Instead, company executives have decided to focuson their churn: the rate at which they lose customers.

They have two teams especially interested in thisdata: the marketing team and the customerservice team.  Each team has its own reason for wanting the analysis. 
The marketing team wants to find out who the most likely people to churnare and create content that suits theirinterests.  The customer service team would like toproactively reach out to customers who areabout to churn, and try to encourage them to stay.
They decide to hire you for two tasks:

* 1.Help them identify the types of customers who churn

* 2.Predict who of their current customers will churnnext month.

To do this, they offer you a file of 7,000 customers.Each row is a customer.  The Churn column will say Yes if the customer churned in the past month.The data also offers demographic dataand data on the services that each customer purchases.

Finally there is information on the payments those customers make.

# Methodology 
 For the First part of the project, We will process with descriptive analysis of the variable in the Dataset that was provided using Python 3 for processing and data visualization. 

We use a hypothesis test on difference of proportion to find if there is any difference between two groups of churners.

After a complete analysis by gender, demographic group and Services used. We will provide recommendations and start the discussion for the solutions.

 We Use Python 3.8.5 64-bit('base':conda) in Windows 10 as OS
